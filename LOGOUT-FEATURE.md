# Logout Feature Implementation

This document describes the implementation of the logout feature in the White Knight Portal application.

## Overview

A "Log Out" option has been added to the profile icon dropdown menu in the application's top navigation bar. This feature allows users to securely log out of the application, clearing their authentication tokens and redirecting them to the login page. A confirmation dialog has been added to prevent accidental logouts.

## Implementation Details

### Changes Made

1. **Added Logout Option to Profile Menu**
   - Added a new "Log Out" menu item to the profile dropdown menu in `src/components/SideMenu.js`
   - The menu item appears at the bottom of the dropdown list

2. **Created Logout Confirmation Dialog**
   - Created a new `LogoutConfirmDialog.js` component
   - The dialog asks users to confirm their intention to log out
   - Provides "Cancel" and "Log Out" buttons

3. **Implemented Two-Step Logout Process**
   - Modified the `handleLogout` function to show the confirmation dialog
   - Added a new `handleConfirmLogout` function that performs the actual logout when confirmed:
     - Removes the authentication token from localStorage
     - Removes the user data from localStorage
     - Closes the confirmation dialog
     - Navigates the user to the login page

### Code Implementation

The updated logout process:

```javascript
// Logout confirmation dialog state
const [openLogoutDialog, setOpenLogoutDialog] = useState(false);

// Show confirmation dialog
const handleLogout = () => {
  setOpenLogoutDialog(true);
  handleCloseProfileMenu();
};

// Perform actual logout when confirmed
const handleConfirmLogout = () => {
  localStorage.removeItem('token');
  localStorage.removeItem('user');
  setOpenLogoutDialog(false);
  navigate('/login');
};
```

The confirmation dialog component:

```jsx
function LogoutConfirmDialog({ open, onClose, onConfirm }) {
  return (
    <Dialog open={open} onClose={onClose}>
      <DialogTitle>Confirm Logout</DialogTitle>
      <DialogContent>
        <DialogContentText>
          Are you sure you want to log out? You will need to sign in again to access your account.
        </DialogContentText>
      </DialogContent>
      <DialogActions>
        <Button onClick={onClose}>Cancel</Button>
        <Button onClick={onConfirm} color="primary" variant="contained" autoFocus>
          Log Out
        </Button>
      </DialogActions>
    </Dialog>
  );
}
```

The menu item added to the profile dropdown:

```jsx
<MenuItem onClick={handleLogout}>
  Log Out
</MenuItem>
```

## Security Considerations

- The implementation ensures that all authentication data is properly cleared from localStorage
- After logout, the user is immediately redirected to the login page
- Any attempt to access protected routes after logout will redirect back to the login page (handled by existing authentication checks)

## How to Test

1. Log in to the application
2. Click on the profile icon in the top-right corner of the navigation bar
3. Select "Log Out" from the dropdown menu
4. Verify that the confirmation dialog appears
5. Click "Cancel" and verify that you remain in the application
6. Repeat steps 2-3, then click "Log Out" in the confirmation dialog
7. Verify that you are redirected to the login page
8. Try to navigate to a protected route (e.g., /dashboard) and verify that you remain on the login page
9. Log in again to verify that the authentication flow works correctly

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements to the logout feature could include:

1. Implementing server-side token invalidation
2. Adding a visual indicator (toast/snackbar) confirming successful logout
3. Adding keyboard shortcut for quick logout
4. Adding an auto-logout feature after a period of inactivity
