# Submissions Page Fix

This document explains the issues with the Submissions page and the fixes that have been implemented.

## Issues Identified

1. **API Endpoint Mismatch**
   - The backend routes in `backend/routes/Applications.js` were defined with incorrect paths
   - Routes were defined as `/applications` but the router was already mounted at `/api/v1/applications` in server.js
   - This caused the full path to be `/api/v1/applications/applications` which didn't match the frontend requests

2. **Authentication Issues**
   - The API requests were not properly handling authentication errors
   - The token format in the headers was not consistent across components

3. **React Router Warning**
   - A warning about "Relative route resolution within Splat routes" was appearing due to missing a future flag

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed API Endpoint Routes

Updated the routes in `backend/routes/Applications.js`:
- Changed `router.get('/applications', ...)` to `router.get('/', ...)`
- Changed `router.put('/applications/:id', ...)` to `router.put('/:id', ...)`
- Changed `router.delete('/applications/:id', ...)` to `router.delete('/:id', ...)`
- Changed `router.post('/applications', ...)` to `router.post('/', ...)`

This ensures that the routes are correctly mounted under `/api/v1/applications` without duplication.

### 2. Improved Authentication Handling

Enhanced the authentication handling in multiple components:

**In SideMenu.js:**
- Added better error handling for the profile fetch
- Added more detailed logging to help diagnose issues
- Improved the token validation check

**In Apps.js:**
- Added detailed logging for API requests and responses
- Improved error handling for failed requests
- Added more context to error messages

### 3. Fixed React Router Warning

Updated the Router configuration in `App.js`:
- Added the `v7_relativeSplatPath: true` future flag to address the warning

## Testing the Changes

To test these changes:

1. Start the backend server:
   ```
   cd backend
   npm start
   ```

2. In a new terminal, start the frontend:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

3. Log in with your credentials

4. Navigate to the Submissions page

5. Check the browser console for any errors or warnings

6. Verify that the applications are being displayed correctly

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter issues:

1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Verify that the backend server is running on port 5000
3. Make sure your MongoDB connection is working
4. Check that the token in localStorage is valid
5. Try clearing your browser cache and localStorage:
   ```javascript
   localStorage.clear()
   ```
   Then log in again

## Technical Details

### API Endpoints

The correct API endpoints for applications are now:

- GET `/api/v1/applications?step=0` - Get applications by step
- PUT `/api/v1/applications/:id` - Update an application
- DELETE `/api/v1/applications/:id` - Delete an application
- POST `/api/v1/applications` - Create a new application

### Authentication

The authentication headers should be formatted as:

```javascript
{
  'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
  'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}
```

Where `token` is retrieved from localStorage.
